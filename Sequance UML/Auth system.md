## Application Overview
**Title:** User Authentication and Data Retrieval App with React and Firebase

### Introduction
This application is designed to provide user authentication and data retrieval functionality using React as the front-end framework and Firebase services for authentication and data storage. The app allows users to log in securely and retrieves user-specific data stored in Firestore.

### Key Components
- **ReactApp (Frontend):**
    - The user interacts with the application through the ReactApp.
    - Responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user actions.
    - Initiates the authentication process with FirebaseAuth.
- **FirebaseAuth (Authentication Service):**
    - Manages user authentication through secure mechanisms.
    - Validates user credentials and returns authentication tokens.
    - Interacts with ReactApp for the authentication process.
- **Firestore (Database Service):**
    - Stores user profiles and related data.
    - The ReactApp communicates with Firestore to store and retrieve user-specific information.
### User Workflow
1. **User Login:**
    - Users initiate the login process by clicking the login button in the ReactApp.
    - ReactApp, hosted on GCP App Engine, communicates with FirebaseAuth to initiate the authentication process.
2. **Authentication Process:**
    - FirebaseAuth validates user credentials and returns authentication tokens to ReactApp.
    - ReactApp stores the user credentials for future interactions.
3. **Data Storage and Retrieval:**
    - After successful authentication, ReactApp communicates with Firestore to store user data in the "userProfiles" collection.
    - The stored data includes user profiles and related information.
4. **Data Retrieval:**
    - When needed, ReactApp requests specific user data from Firestore.
    - Firestore retrieves the requested data and returns it to ReactApp for display or further processing.
### Sequence of Actions (Sequence Diagram)
The sequence diagram illustrates the step-by-step interaction between user, ReactApp, FirebaseAuth, and Firestore during the login and data retrieval process.

### Conclusion
This application provides a secure and seamless user experience by leveraging React for the frontend and Firebase services for authentication and data storage. Users can log in, and the app retrieves and displays personalized data from Firestore.
