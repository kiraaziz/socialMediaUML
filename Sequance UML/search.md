## Overview
The Search System is a React-based web application integrated with Firebase services, including Firestore and FirebaseAuth. The application allows users to perform searches for groups, retrieve relevant information, and interact with the search results.

## Workflow
1. **User Interaction:**
    - A user interacts with the React-based web application by typing search text.
2. **Fetching Suggestions:**
    - The React application sends a request to Firestore to fetch suggestions based on the user's search text.
3. **Display Suggestions:**
    - While the user is typing, Firestore returns suggestions to the React application. This loop continues until the user stops typing.
4. **User Authentication:**
    - Once the user decides to perform a search, the React application requests the user ID from FirebaseAuth.
5. **Searching Groups:**
    - The React application sends a request to Firestore to search for groups by name.
6. **Group Found:**
    - If the group is found, the React application receives a list of groups from Firestore.
    - The application checks the user's membership status in the group.
    - If the user is a member, the application retrieves posts by content.
    - For each post, the application fetches the poster's profile data.
7. **No Group Found:**
    - If no group is found, the React application informs the user that there are no results.
8. **Save/Update Search Text:**
    - The React application saves or updates the user's search text in Firestore.
## Conclusion
The Search System provides users with a seamless experience by offering real-time suggestions, authenticating users, and presenting relevant information about groups and posts. The integration with Firebase enhances the application's functionality and ensures efficient data management.
